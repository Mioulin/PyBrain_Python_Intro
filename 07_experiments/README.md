# Experiments

Unfortunately, running psychological experiments in Python isn't very possible through Jupyter Notebooks. However, an example experiment is included here. If you were part of the PyBrain workshop, you would have seen a live run-through. If you're reading this afterwards, you're still very welcome to have a look at the scripts. They're reasonably well commented, so hopefully they will still be somewhat informative.
